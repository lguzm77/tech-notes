You may consider following semantic versioning when versioning a JSON object data model
```json
{
"version": "0.0.0" // Follow X,Y,Z convention
}
```
Consider a semantic version with the format X.Y.Z.
Z will increment only when bug fixes are applied
Y will increment only when backwards compatible features are added.
X will increment only when non backwards compatible changes are added. 

A version of 0.Y.Z indicates that the product/api is still in development and should not be considered stable.
