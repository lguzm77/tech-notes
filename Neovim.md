Some nice tricks -

As a replacement for `ciw` (delete an entire word and enter insert mode) just do `cw`

If you want to select some text you can use
- `viw` - selects a word only
- viW - selects all characters until the next whitespace
You can replace v with y or d to yank or delete text appropriately
